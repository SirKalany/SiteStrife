  "history": "The Neubaufahrzeug (NbFz) was an experimental German heavy tank designed in the early 1930s as part of Germany’s initial rearmament program. Intended to explore multi-turret layouts and heavy armament for breakthrough operations, the vehicle served primarily as a testbed for automotive and weapons concepts rather than a production combat system. Only a handful of vehicles were built, and they saw limited action for propaganda and training purposes.",
