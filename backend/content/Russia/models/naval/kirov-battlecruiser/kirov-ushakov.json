  "service": "The Kirov, later renamed Admiral Ushakov, was laid down in 1974, launched in 1977, and commissioned in 1980 as part of the Soviet Northern Fleet. Her first major voyage took place in 1984 to the Mediterranean, but during her second deployment in 1989â€“1990 she suffered a reactor accident that forced her into reserve. Never repaired due to the collapse of the USSR and lack of funds, she was eventually cannibalized for spare parts. Renamed Admiral Ushakov in 1992, plans for her overhaul repeatedly stalled, and by the early 2000s she was slated for dismantlement. Although restoration was briefly reconsidered, her deteriorated state and the risks posed by her nuclear reactors made repairs unfeasible. Ultimately, Russia decided in 2019 to scrap the ship, with dismantling scheduled for 2021."
