# Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9

## Description

The **Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9** was the first Soviet turbojet fighter developed during and in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. Drawing heavily on captured German jet technology, it became the first jet-powered aircraft produced by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau to take flight, as well as its first national turbojet aircraft, marking the Soviet Union's entry into the jet age.

## Development

In early 1945, with the Second World War still raging in Europe, the Soviet **Council of People's Commissars** issued a directive for a new type of aircraft: a single-seat jet-powered fighter capable of engaging enemy bombers at high altitude. This was to be the USSR’s first attempt at a jet fighter. The design was to use two of the German **BMW 003 turbojets**, which had been captured by Soviet forces and reverse-engineered as the **RD-20**. The aircraft was expected to reach speeds near 900 km/h at sea level and perform well at 5,000 meters. It was to be equipped with heavy cannon armament to take down large enemy aircraft.

The task fell to the **Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau**, which quickly set to work on a prototype designated the **I-300**. The team adopted a **pod-and-boom layout** to accommodate the engines and armament while providing good pilot visibility and ground handling. The twin RD-20 engines were mounted low in the fuselage with exhausts under the tail. Air intakes were placed in the nose, and an unpressurized cockpit sat over the engine nacelles. The aircraft had **unswept mid-mounted wings** and a **tricycle undercarriage**, novel at the time for Soviet designs.

Initial armament included a massive **57 mm cannon** placed in the intake splitter bulkhead, accompanied by two **23 mm cannons** on either side beneath the nose intake. As the weapons were larger than previous aircraft, usually mounting 12,7 mm guns and 20 mm cannons, the I-300 had less ammunition, a downside it made up with sheer firepower. While impressive on paper, this armament led to a serious issue: the firing of the cannons produced gases that entered the engines, causing frequent **flameouts**. Despite this, the I-300 took its first flight on **24 April 1946**, narrowly beating Yakovlev’s Yak-15 to become the first Soviet jet to fly — thanks to a coin toss.

Flight testing revealed additional structural problems, particularly with the **tail unit and fuselage heatshield**, which had to be redesigned. Despite these flaws, the Soviet leadership was determined to press on. A small batch of pre-production aircraft was ordered before testing had concluded. This version was designated **MiG-9 (I-301)**, and production began at **Factory No. 1** in Kuybyshev.

In 1947, a second version, the **MiG-9M (I-307)**, introduced refinements such as improved fuel systems, air brakes, and attempts to fix the gas ingestion issue. Despite these changes, the MiG-9M failed to meet expectations and was overshadowed by the development of the far more capable **MiG-15**. Various experimental MiG-9 derivatives were created, such as the **I-305** with a single Lyulka TR-1 engine and the **I-320** with a British Nene turbojet, but these projects were abandoned.

A two-seat trainer variant, **UTI MiG-9 (I-301T)**, was developed to help transition pilots to jet aircraft. It featured **tandem cockpits** and **ejection seats** based on German designs. Though it was briefly considered for production, poor visibility from the rear seat and the obsolescence of the MiG-9 by the time tests concluded led to its cancellation.

## Service

In operational service, the **MiG-9 was introduced in 1948** but was soon replaced by the MiG-15. Nonetheless, it was used briefly by several Soviet Air Armies and was **exported to China**, where **over 370 units** were delivered for air defense and jet training roles.

As the **Korean War** escalated with the entry of China into the conflict, the Soviets pressured the Chinese to use the MiG-9 against American aircraft. However, Chinese commanders opted instead to **retrain their pilots on the newer MiG-15**, which was better suited for the conflict.

The MiG-9 marked an important technological step for Soviet aviation, but its brief service life and persistent design flaws limited its effectiveness. Despite this, the aircraft provided **invaluable experience in jet technology** and laid the groundwork for future successes like the MiG-15.
