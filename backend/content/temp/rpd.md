# RPD Machine Gun

## Description

The **RPD**, or **Degtyaryov hand-held machine gun**, is a light machine gun designed and produced by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to replace the aging Degtyaryov machine gun (DP-27/DP-28). The main difference between the RPD and the older DP was the use of the newly developed **7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge**, which would become one of the most popular cartridges in the world.

## Characteristics

- **Type:** Light machine gun  
- **Cartridge:** 7.62×39mm / 5.56×45mm NATO (Israeli conversion)  
- **Rate of Fire:** 650–750 rounds/min  
- **Effective Range:** 800 m (realistic effective range around 300–500 m)  
- **Feed:** 100-round non-disintegrating belt in a drum container; 125-round belt (MACV-SOG variant)  
- **Weight:** 7.4 kg empty, approx. 9 kg loaded  
- **Length:** 103.7 cm  
- **Number Built:** 300,000–400,000 (Soviet production only; Chinese and other productions increase total numbers significantly)  

## Development

By 1943, the Soviet Union tasked its engineers to produce a new light machine gun to replace the older DP machine gun. This new weapon was to use the 7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge, which was still in development at the time, but field testing showed promising results. Among the engineers chosen for the project were already experienced weapon designers such as Sergei Simonov, who designed the AVS-36 and SKS; Alexei Sudayev, known for the PPS submachine gun; and Vasily Degtyaryov himself, the original creator of the DP machine gun.

Many prototypes and designs were proposed, such as Simonov's **SIM-47**, Sudayev's **AS-44**, and Degtyaryov's **RD-44**. During testing, Degtyaryov's design proved superior to its rivals and was accepted into service under the name **RPD model 1944**. While the weapon proved its worth, the lack of other weapons using the 7.62×39mm round meant that ammunition was limited and could not yet be supplied to the entire Red Army. Between its acceptance in 1944 and official adoption by the army in 1948, the RPD underwent several minor modifications.

By the time the RPD was distributed among Soviet troops in 1953, the SKS and AK-47 were being mass-produced as well, creating an informal family of weapons chambered in 7.62×39mm. Many consider the RPD to be one of the earliest squad automatic weapons that influenced later designs for decades.

## Service

Compared to previous service machine guns worldwide, the RPD was lighter for a belt-fed gun, with the drum carrier and open-bolt firing providing good ergonomics. Each squad could have a dedicated machine gunner who did not require multiple soldiers to operate the weapon effectively, unlike older belt-fed machine guns. On the other hand, the **non-disintegrating belt** meant that after firing, the user had to carry the empty belt, which, while not heavy, could reduce mobility.

Like most Soviet weapons, the RPD was a robust and simple weapon, capable of functioning in harsh environments with good maintenance. While reliable, the RPD could not change its barrel quickly in the field, restricting the user to firing short bursts or risking barrel overheating. This became a problem because the RPD fires **only fully automatic**, allowing inexperienced users to potentially damage the barrel by firing excessively in a short time, although the weapon would need to fire multiple belts continuously to significantly impact effectiveness.

While the RPD and its variants never saw action in the Second World War, it was used in almost every major Cold War conflict, including the Vietnam War, Sino-Indian War, Six-Day and Yom Kippur Wars, Soviet-Afghan War, Iran-Iraq War, Gulf War, and more recently, conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War, Libyan Civil War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Although more modern alternatives exist, the mass-produced Soviet and Chinese RPDs are still used by militias and armies requiring inexpensive and reliable light machine guns. Manufactured in the hundreds of thousands, it became very common worldwide, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union.

## Variants

Several variants of the RPD exist, mostly produced by foreign countries under license or captured. These include:

- The Chinese **Type 56** and **Type 56-1** light machine guns (not to be confused with the Type 56 assault rifle, which is a licensed copy of the AK-47). There is little difference between the Soviet RPD and the Type 56, although the Type 56-1 features a folding cleaning rod stored in the weapon’s buttstock.
- The North Korean **Type 62**, a licensed copy of the RPD produced locally.
- A modified RPD converted to use **5.56×45mm NATO**, made by Israel after capturing Egyptian RPDs during the Six-Day and Yom Kippur Wars.
- A modified RPD with a shortened barrel and 125-round belt, made and used by **MACV-SOG**, a United States special operations unit active during the Vietnam War.
