# Soviet T‑64 Main Battle Tank

## Description

The **T‑64** is a Soviet second-generation main battle tank (MBT), first produced in the early 1960s. Developed by the **Kharkiv Morozov Machine-Building Design Bureau (KMDB)**, it pioneered several features—most notably the **125 mm smoothbore gun with an autoloader**, **composite armor**, and a **compact, high-power diesel engine**—that would define future Soviet tank design. Although technologically advanced, the T‑64 was more expensive and complex than its counterparts (T‑62 and T‑72), leading to lim...

## Characteristics

- **Crew:** 3 (commander, gunner, driver)  
- **Main Armament:** 125 mm 2A46-series smoothbore gun (36 rounds, 28 with autoloader)  
- **Secondary Armament:** 1 × 7.62 mm PKT coaxial, 1 × 12.7 mm NSVT anti-aircraft gun  
- **Engine:** 5TDF 4-stroke, multi-fuel, 700 hp (515 kW) diesel  
- **Transmission:** Torsion-bar suspension, 6 road wheels per side  
- **Dimensions:** Length 9.23 m (gun forward), Width 3.6 m, Height ~2.2 m  
- **Weight:** ~42.5 t  
- **Performance:** • Max speed 60 km/h road, 35 km/h off-road  
  • Range 500 km (standard), 700 km with external tanks  
  • Power-to-weight ratio ~16 hp/t  
- **Protection:** Composite armor (steel-aluminum-steel), later ERA upgrades like Kontakt-5 on models like T‑64BV/BM

## Development

- Initiated in the early 1950s to match NATO tanks and overcome limitations of the T‑55/T‑62 line.  
- The **Object 430** prototype (late 1950s) introduced composite armor and a 100 mm gun.  
- **Object 432** variant (1961) standardized most features and entered production in 1963, officially entering service in 1967.  
- Features innovative **autoloader** for the 125 mm gun, reducing crew to three and enabling a smaller turret.  
- Influenced subsequent Soviet designs like the **T-80** and **T-80UD/T-84**.

## Service

- Primarily fielded by Soviet tank divisions from the late 1960s.  
- Never exported; reserved for frontline units in East Germany and Hungary during the Cold War.  
- Saw limited combat in Chechnya; complex systems and autoloader reliability issues hampered performance.  
- After USSR dissolution, over 2,000 T‑64s entered Ukrainian service, with some 4,000 retained in Russia. Ukraine has modernized these into BV, BM, BM2 "Bulat" versions.

## Variants

### Object 430  
- **Prototype** (late 1950s): 100 mm gun, composite armor, 580 hp engine  

### Object 432 / T‑64  
- **Initial production** (1963–1966): 115 mm D-68 smoothbore gun  

### T‑64A (Ob'yekt 434, 1967)  
- 125 mm D‑81T gun, autoloader, improved sights, added side skirts and smoke grenade dischargers  

### T‑64AK (Ob'yekt 446, 1972)  
- Command version with mast antenna and enhanced comms; removed AA machine gun  

### T‑64B (Ob'yekt 447A, 1976)  
- 9K112 "Kobra" ATGM system via main gun, upgraded armor and FCS; later fitted with ERA (T‑64BV) and upgraded engine (T‑64BM)  

### T‑64BV / T‑64BM  
- BV: ERA-equipped variant  
- BM: Upgraded with 1,000 hp 6TD engine  

### Ukrainian Modernization: T‑64BV mod 2017, T‑64BM Bulat, T‑64BM2  
- New multi-fuel engines (57DFM/6TDs), modern FCS, ERA, KBA3 gun; led to T‑64BM2 “Bulat”.

### Support Variants  
- T‑64R: Upgraded command vehicles  
- T‑64K: command variants and recovery versions (BREM)  

## Strengths & Limitations

- ✅ **Advanced protection & firepower** for its era, compact design  
- ✅ **Autoloader** reduced crew and vehicle size  
- ❌ **Complex maintenance** and reliability issues with early engines and autoloader  
- ❌ **High cost**, limited deployment led to smaller production (~6,000–13,000 units) compared to T‑72  
- ⚠️ **Crew workload**: commander double-tasking as loader; maintenance burden increased due to fewer crew
